			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Fire Emblem is a Strategy-RPG series developed by Nintendo's Intelligent Systems.</p>
			<p>
				After playing and loving the Fire Emblem games for while Daniel got tired of looking up the characters that are available in each game, so he tried to create a little compendium for them here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ideally, every character would have a picture, their starting class, level, stats and stat growths, but these aren't always available in easily machine-readable form, so sometimes he had to make do with less.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enjoy! \o/
